Task 2: Solving a system of linear equations. Note: you can initialize data (coefficient etc.) as arrays or lists in the program, no need to enter complete equations into the program.)

A)
x + y + z = 6
x + 2y + 2z = 11
2x + 3y - 4z = 3

B)
w + 2x - y + z = 6
-w + x + 2y - z = 3
2w - x + 2y + 2z = 14
w + x - y + 2z = 8
